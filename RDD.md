**RDD â€” Resilient	Distributed	Dataset**

**Resilient	Distributed	Dataset	(aka	RDD)**	is	the	primary	data	abstraction	in	Apache	Spark
and	the	core of Spark.

A	RDD	is	a	resilient	and	distributed	collection	of	records	spread	over	one	or	many	partitions.

One	could	compare	RDDs	to	collections	in	Scala,	i.e.	a	RDD	is	computed	on
many	JVMs	while	a	Scala	collection	lives	on	a	single	JVM.
